# Learning Journal day 8 - Jan  30th, 2018

Today I learned the importance of keeping up with due dates and making sure that you turn everything on time(even though due dates only count for Labs). Taking 2 days off made me feel far behind. When I checked what was due after missing 2 days, I felt overloaded with the amount of assignments that needed to be turned in.
